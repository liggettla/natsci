# Aging {#aging}

## Introduction
Below is a nice timeline of some major milestones in aging research [@campisi2019discoveries].

## Somatic Mutation Theory
In their study covering 7,664 tumors, Martincorena and Campbell illustrate an almost complete absence of negative selection against somatic mutations [@martincorena2017universal]. This is lack of negative selection is quite different from the force at the population level where it acts quite strongly on the germline. This result may be an important finding for the somatic theory of aging [@morley1995somatic], as it may be an indication that point mutations are largely of negligible effect size
within somatic cells. As such, if point mutations do play a role in aging, it seems that this may be limited to those that are neutral or advantageous to a cell.

## Calorie Restriction
1939 was the first time that calorie restriction was shown in mice and rates to increase lifespan [@mccay1935effect]. This effect of longevity has also been reproduced in primates [@pifferi2018caloric; @mattison2017caloric].

## Genetics of Aging
Peter Medawar proposed in 1952 that aging is the result of a reduction in the force of natural selection for a species after its reproductive years [@medawar1952unsolved]. In part this theory seems a bit obvious as at its core it really seems to state that organisms evolve to their niches. Furthermore, it may seem a bit simplified to me as organisms appear to have significantly different fertility loss and survivorship relationships. In the following figure the fertility rates in humans and _C. elegans_ appear to be rather similar, but their mortality curves appear to be strikingly different [@aguilaniu2015mysterious].

```

Here is a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between fertility and mortality [@jones2014diversity]. The diversity in the following figure makes me inclined to wonder if Medawar was fundamentally flawed in assumption that fertility rates decrease as a function of age and it and other losses in functionality are the result of a systemic relaxation in the forces of selection with the age of an organism.

In part, motivated by the theories begun by Medawar, selection experiments were performed in _Drosophila_ to select for late breeding, and this yielded a nearly two-fold increase in maximum lifespan [@rose1980test]. In part, this illustrates that lifespan can be significantly dependent on genetics and or epigenetics. At least 800 genes have been directly implicated in lifespan regulation in _C. elegans_ (though in light of Jonathan Pritchard's work, I can only imagine this number will continue to climb until it reaches the total gene count in each organism), and these genes can be found [here](http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.php?organism=Caenorhabditis+elegans&show=4).

Supercentenarians and the oldest populations concentrate nicely within areas that have no birth certificates and a shorter mean lifespan the general country [@Newman2019-zs]. Examples of this trend are Okinawa, Sardinia, and Ikaria. It may be possible that part of the reason for the substantial increase in maximum lifespan is due to fraud especially as people that get payments from the government like social security can be useful to people that just claim to be an elderly person that has died.

## Aging Pathways and Processes
In 1993 a _C. elegans_ mutation in _daf-2_ which is orthologous to mammalian genes for insulin and insulin-like growth factor was found to nearly double the lifespan of the organism [@kenyon1993c].

Target of rapamycin (TOR) proteins have important metabolic effects that also impact maximum lifespan. A common evolutionary hypothesis for the general role of TOR in modulation of maximum lifespan is that it shifts metabolic investment from reproduction and growth into somatic maintenance, and that this switch increases the longevity of an organism [@kapahi2010tor].

In 1995 Brian Kennedy identified the epigenetic silencing factors, sirtuins (Sir) in yeast [@kennedy1995mutation]. Sir2 is a protein deacetylase that depends on the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) [@imai2000transcriptional]. On the basis that NAD+ levels increase during conditions that are typically associated with longevity such as exercise, fasting, and dietary restriction, it is commonly suggested that NAD+ supplementation may increase lifespan (though this idea seems a bit simple to me) [@mouchiroud2013nad].
