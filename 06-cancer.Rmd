## Introduction
### Incidence Rates
Time and age plays a major role in the occurrence of many cancers, where typically the risk of suffering most cancers is about 2% by the age of 40 in humans, while the risk increases to about 50% by the age of 80 [@martincorena2015somatic].

## Oncogenesis
Understanding the cell of origin for a cancer is difficult, but it appears that using ATAC-Seq to measure open chromatin regions within tumor cells can identify the hematopoietic cell of origin [@george2016leukaemia]. This appears to be prognostically relevant as the more stemlike the cell of origin in AML, the worse the prognosis of the patient appears to be [@young2016open].

### Mutation Order
While NPM1 and FLT3-ITD are commonly altered in AML, they appear to not be observed in CHIP, suggesting and consistent with other results that these changes occur late in the process of oncogenesis [@mckerrell2015leukemia; @kronke2013clonal; @abelson2018prediction].

## Aging Related Tissue Clonality
While the Martincorena group has shown that skin epithelium contains a significant number of cells that carry putatively oncogenic mutations, it is possible that this result may have been directly correlated with UV damage from sun exposure. Sequencing of esophageal endothelium revealed that NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations were widespread throughout the tissue [@yokoyama2019age; @martincorena2018somatic]. The magnitude with which the tissue was covered by NOTCH1 mutated clones could be increased with chronic smoking and drinking. Furthermore, NOTCH1 mutant clones appeared to be less prevalent in esophageal cancers, and may be indicative of protective effects of the mutant clones.

By classifying oncogenic mutations by the number of times they occurred in cosmic, and stratifying into low, intermediate, and high occurrence mutations, it appears that when more high risk mutations occur in CHIP, they are significantly predictive of progression to AML [@abelson2018prediction].

Using a model that holds DFE constant of those mutations consistently observed in CHIP, a static mutation accumulation rate may be mathematically sufficient to explain CHIP incidence [@Watson2019-lg].

Using TOPMed whole genome sequencing to measure CHIP, it appears that CHIP is associated with different inflammatory traits, and that TERT/TET2 SNPs predispose to CHIP [@Bick2019-ji].

## Myeloproliferative Neoplasms

### Overview

The class of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms consists of a few different clonal hematopoietic disorders including polycythemia vera, which is characterized by red-cell overproduction; essential thrombocythemia, which involves elevated platelet counts; and myelofibrosis, which is defined by bone marrow fibrosis [@grinfeld2018classification]. The myelofibrosis MPN subtype can follow and accompany the other subtypes. Myelofibrosis can also appear not in combination with the other two subtypes; termed secondary myelofibrosis (SMF) [@mesa2012epidemiology]. Using clinical and laboratory features, the three subtypes of MPN can be distinguished but the division of the three can often be quite unclear [@wilkins2008bone; @tefferi2014overview]. The major driver mutations in MPNs are JAK2, CALR, and MPL, and are largely mutually exclusive, though other accompanying mutations are common [@tefferi2015myeloproliferative]. Diagnosis is currently performed using bone marrow morphology especially in distinguishing ET from prefibrotic PMF.

In the above figure, the LOH occurring at chr9p JAK2 V617F homozygosity, or a high JAK2 V617F allele burden correlated with polycythemia vera.  

While the identities of driver mutations can predict disease phenotype and prognosis [@vannucchi2013mutations; @tefferi2016targeted; @yogarajah2017leukemic] especially when accompanied by mutation order, it is unclear how the complex genetic landscape of MPNs contributes to the varied diagnostic features of the disease. SF3B1 and DNMT3a mutations commonly drive MPNs; as these appear to drive clonal hematopoiesis it may be possible that some MPNs are arising from asymptomatic clones that have come to dominate the hematopoietic system in a similar manner to CHIP.

[@grinfeld2018classification]  

It is interesting to note that the mutation order can influence the type of MPN [@ortmann2015effect; @nangalia2015dnmt3a]. When JAK2 is the first mutation, it tends to produce PV, but when TET2 is the initiating mutation, it tends to produce ET [@ortmann2015effect]. MPNs that begin with JAK2 mutations also appear to be more sensitive to the JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib.  

The concept of genetic canalization or functional buffering is one that describes the consequences of an early mutation, and how it influences the range of future compatible mutations [@ashworth2011genetic; @hartman2001principles]. Some mutations however, have been observed to occur both early and late during tumor progression, perhaps suggesting that the final properties of a tumor are more reflective of the sum of the mutation effects rather than the evolutionary path taken.As an example, in NPM, when TET2 if mutated first, it appears to alter the transcriptional consequences of a subsequent JAK2 mutation.

In the above figure, HSPCs originating from a clone that first acquired either a JAK2 or TET2 mutation are expanded in culture to look for an effect of mutation order on the lineage generation [@ortmann2015effect]. Each bar is a different set of clones coming from a particular MPN type as labeled along the x-axis, and shows an apparent transcriptional difference when the mutation acquisition order is changed. This is perhaps in part due to the epigenetic effects of TET2 mutation when it is the founder mutation.

[@grinfeld2018classification]  

Using Mayo Clinic patients as an approximation for overall MPN incidence, about 12% of all MPN incidence occurs within patients under 40 years of age, with the median age of incidence being 50 years [@szuber2018myeloproliferative]. With a median follow-up period of roughly 10 years, leukemia incidence is really not all that high, at about 5% on average. The probability of developing fibrosis is elevated in the younger individuals, which may be explained by a conspicuously longer expected survival time. Mean survival times in the Mayo Clinic data are 37, 35, 20 for under 40, 22, 22, 8 for 40-60, and 10, 11, 3 for over 60 for PV, ET, and PMF respectively [@szuber2018myeloproliferative; @tefferi2015myeloproliferative]. The disease complications are typically thrombosis, leukemic transformation, or fibrotic transformation. In PV and ET, risk factors for survival include older age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis, whereas JAK2 mutation in ET is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis risk in PV is typically treated by phlebotomy to reduce haematocrit levels, or aspirin to reduce clotting potential in both PV and ET. Those individuals that are at a high risk of clotting may also be given hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha and busulfan as cytoreductive agents. Though the JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib has been approved for use in treating hydroxyurea-resistant PV it is still unclear what the effects of chronic administration are.

### Genetics
JAK2 is the most common of the mutations found within MPNs, occurring in about 98% of PV 55% in ET and 60% in PMF [@tefferi2015myeloproliferative]. JAK2 mutations also appear to be generally associated with old age, while CALR and PMF are more associated with young age. Below is a more in-depth understanding of the link between certain disease subtypes and the mutations associated with them. It is possible that JAK2 and MPL mutations directly activate JAK-STAT which allows cells to proliferate in a cytokine independent manner.

```
[@tefferi2015myeloproliferative]  

It is possible that JAK-STAT activation plays a key role in the development of MPNs, but it seems that people are confused why MPNs exist in an inflammatory state with altered cytokine signaling. I'm not sure I understand why the two understandings are inconsistent with each other [@rampal2014integrated].

### Disease Manifestations
Complete blood counts exceed the upper limit of the WHO reference range. Other characteristic features include palpable splenomegaly, anemia, aquagenic pruritus (itching when skin contacts water), unusual thrombosis such as portal or hepatic vein thrombosis, bone marrow fibrosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. A more complete explanation of diagnostics can be found in the figure below.

## Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
It appears that immune elimination of neoantigens during early tumor evolution may be rather negligible [@Van_den_Eynden2019-mn]. Signal of elimination of mutants that express neoantigens is essentially eliminated when accounting for the effect of trinucleotide context in mutation patterns.
