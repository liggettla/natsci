## Introduction
### Incidence Rates
Time and age plays a major role in the occurrence of many cancers, where typically the risk of suffering most cancers is about 2% by the age of 40 in humans, while the risk increases to about 50% by the age of 80 [@martincorena2015somatic].

## Oncogenesis
Understanding the cell of origin for a cancer is difficult, but it appears that using ATAC-Seq to measure open chromatin regions within tumor cells can identify the hematopoietic cell of origin [@george2016leukaemia]. This appears to be prognostically relevant as the more stemlike the cell of origin in AML, the worse the prognosis of the patient appears to be [@young2016open].

### Mutation Order
While NPM1 and FLT3-ITD are commonly altered in AML, they appear to not be observed in CHIP, suggesting and consistent with other results that these changes occur late in the process of oncogenesis [@mckerrell2015leukemia; @kronke2013clonal; @abelson2018prediction].

## Aging Related Tissue Clonality
While the Martincorena group has shown that skin epithelium contains a significant number of cells that carry putatively oncogenic mutations, it is possible that this result may have been directly correlated with UV damage from sun exposure. Sequencing of esophageal endothelium revealed that NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations were widespread throughout the tissue [@yokoyama2019age; @martincorena2018somatic]. The magnitude with which the tissue was covered by NOTCH1 mutated clones could be increased with chronic smoking and drinking. Furthermore, NOTCH1 mutant clones appeared to be less prevalent in esophageal cancers, and may be indicative of protective effects of the mutant clones.

By classifying oncogenic mutations by the number of times they occurred in cosmic, and stratifying into low, intermediate, and high occurrence mutations, it appears that when more high risk mutations occur in CHIP, they are significantly predictive of progression to AML [@abelson2018prediction].

Using a model that holds DFE constant of those mutations consistently observed in CHIP, a static mutation accumulation rate may be mathematically sufficient to explain CHIP incidence [@Watson2019-lg].

## Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The class of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms consists of a few different clonal hematopoietic disorders including polycythemia vera, which is characterized by red-cell overproduction; essential thrombocythemia, which involves elevated platelet counts; and myelofibrosis, which is defined by bone marrow fibrosis [@grinfeld2018classification]. The myelofibrosis MPN subtype can follow and accompany the other subtypes. Myelofibrosis can also appear not in combination with the other two subtypes; termed secondary myelofibrosis (SMF) [@mesa2012epidemiology]. Using clinical and laboratory features, the three subtypes of MPN can be distinguished but the division of the three can often be quite unclear [@wilkins2008bone; @tefferi2014overview]. The major driver mutations in MPNs are JAK2, CALR, and MPL, though accompanying mutations are common.

In the above figure, the LOH occurring at chr9p JAK2 V617F homozygosity, or a high JAK2 V617F allele burden correlated with polycythemia vera.  

While the identities of driver mutations can predict disease phenotype and prognosis [@vannucchi2013mutations; @tefferi2016targeted; @yogarajah2017leukemic] especially when accompanied by mutation order, it is unclear how the complex genetic landscape of MPNs contributes to the varied diagnostic features of the disease. SF3B1 and DNMT3a mutations commonly drive MPNs; as these appear to drive clonal hematopoiesis it may be possible that some MPNs are arising from asymptomatic clones that have come to dominate the hematopoietic system in a similar manner to CHIP.

It is interesting to note that the mutation order can influence the type of MPN [@ortmann2015effect; @nangalia2015dnmt3a].

Using Mayo Clinic patients as an approximation for overall MPN incidence, about 12% of all MPN incidence occurs within patients under 40 years of age [@szuber2018myeloproliferative]. With a median follow-up period of roughly 10 years, leukemia incidence is really not all that high, at about 5% on average. The probability of developing fibrosis is elevated in the younger individuals, which may be explained by a longer time to death.
