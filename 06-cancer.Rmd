## Introduction
### Incidence Rates
Time and age plays a major role in the occurrence of many cancers, where typically the risk of suffering most cancers is about 2% by the age of 40 in humans, while the risk increases to about 50% by the age of 80 [@martincorena2015somatic].

## Oncogenesis
Understanding the cell of origin for a cancer is difficult, but it appears that using ATAC-Seq to measure open chromatin regions within tumor cells can identify the hematopoietic cell of origin [@george2016leukaemia]. This appears to be prognostically relevant as the more stemlike the cell of origin in AML, the worse the prognosis of the patient appears to be [@young2016open].

### Mutation Order
While NPM1 and FLT3-ITD are commonly altered in AML, they appear to not be observed in CHIP, suggesting and consistent with other results that these changes occur late in the process of oncogenesis [@mckerrell2015leukemia; @kronke2013clonal; @abelson2018prediction].

## Aging Related Tissue Clonality
While the Martincorena group has shown that skin epithelium contains a significant number of cells that carry putatively oncogenic mutations, it is possible that this result may have been directly correlated with UV damage from sun exposure. Sequencing of esophageal endothelium revealed that NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations were widespread throughout the tissue [@yokoyama2019age; @martincorena2018somatic]. The magnitude with which the tissue was covered by NOTCH1 mutated clones could be increased with chronic smoking and drinking. Furthermore, NOTCH1 mutant clones appeared to be less prevalent in esophageal cancers, and may be indicative of protective effects of the mutant clones.

By classifying oncogenic mutations by the number of times they occurred in cosmic, and stratifying into low, intermediate, and high occurence mutations, it appears that when more high risk mutations occur in CHIP, they are significantly predictive of progression to AML [@abelson2018prediction].
