## Clonal Dynamics
It appears that in physiologically typical states that are unperturbed by irradiation, HSCs equally and continually contribute to hematopoiesis, rather than asynchronously contributing by periodically cycling and then becoming quiescent [@lu2019clonal]. It also appears that the number of mutations per HSC is roughly 1000 with only a small degree of variance, and there does not appear to be a distinction between typical HSCs and an ultra-quiescent pool of HSCs [@lee2018population].
