## Alzheimer's Disease 
It seems that the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis may be partially responsible for exacerbating symptoms in people with AD. Observation of the bacteria in the brains of people with AD showed evidence that the bacteria secreted proteases called gingipains that increased Aβ production and were also neurotoxic. Inhibition of the proteases reduced neuroinflammation and rescued neurons in the hippocampus (Dominy 2019).

Tied both to sleep and AD, it appears that chronic sleep deprivation increases the formation of Aβ plaques, perhaps suggesting that sleep is protective against the formation of the plaques that eventually lead to AD [@Holth2019-cd].

## Sleep
Sleep deprivation results in the global phosphorylation of the brain proteome, an effect which is reversed by sleep. A mouse mutant for SIK3 causes mice to sleep more, and may play an important role in the cause of sleep desire (Wang et al. 2018).
