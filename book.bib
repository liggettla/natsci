  abstract = "Genetic rescue (GR) is an important tool in conservation biology
              for the management of highly inbred populations. However, GR
              comes at a potential cost: the reduction in native genomic
              content. The degree to which adaptive evolution for new immigrant
              alleles lead to complete or partial replacement of the native
              genome, depends on recombination rates, genome size, effective
              population sizes, and distributions of fitness effects. As one of
              the most well-studied examples of an inbred species that
              exchanged genetic material with a less inbred species, we use
              Neanderthals and humans as an example. Using simulations, we show
              that for parameters realistic for these species, the increase in
              fitness caused by GR is mirrored by an almost proportional
              reduction in the fraction of the native genome preserved. The
              main reason is that the effect of selection will be strongest in
              the first few generations during which time there is only little
              break-up, by recombination, of the immigrant chromosomes. We also
              show that in the presence of a strong and short-lived bottleneck
              with recessive mutations, GR leads to a stronger increase in
              fitness than in the presence of additive effects or a more
              prolonged bottleneck.",

              chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases A$\beta$ plaques.
              However, tau, not A$\beta$, accumulation appears to drive AD
              neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding
              and spreading were influenced by the sleep-wake cycle and SD.
              Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90\% during normal wakefulness
              versus sleep and ~100\% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased
              more than 50\% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model,
              chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically
              driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF
              A$\beta$ and tau. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle regulates ISF tau,

              determinants of cancer risk. Whether variants confer a fitness
              advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance, however,
              remains largely unknown. Here, by combining blood sequencing data
              from ∼50,000 individuals, we reveal how mutation, genetic drift
              and fitness differences combine to shape the genetic diversity of
              healthy blood (`clonal haematopoiesis'). By analysing the
              spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness
              advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide
              bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive
              selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal
              haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele
              frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance
              differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with
              differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants.
              Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is
              driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the
              data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply
              by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions
              that lead to increased detectability at older ages.",

              understood. A comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing data from
              ~6700 samples across 29 normal tissues revealed multiple somatic
              variants, demonstrating that macroscopic clones can be found in
              many normal tissues. We found that sun-exposed skin, esophagus,
              and lung have a higher mutation burden than other tested tissues,
              which suggests that environmental factors can promote somatic
              mosaicism. Mutation burden was associated with both age and
              tissue-specific cell proliferation rate, highlighting that
              mutations accumulate over both time and number of cell divisions.
              Finally, normal tissues were found to harbor mutations in known
              cancer genes and hotspots. This study provides a broad view of
              macroscopic clonal expansion in human tissues, thus serving as a
              foundation for associating clonal expansion with environmental
              factors, aging, and risk of disease.",

              regions with no birth certificates and short lifespans",
  author   = "Newman, Saul Justin",
  abstract = "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and
              their concentration into geographic sub-regions or 9blue zones9,
              has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers
              of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong
              social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new
              predictors of remarkable longevity and 9supercentenarian9 status.
              In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the
              absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of
              birth certificates is associated with a 69-82\% fall in the
              number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, which has more
              uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead
              predicted by low per capita incomes and a short life expectancy.
              Finally, the designated 9blue zones9 of Sardinia, Okinawa, and
              Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy,
              high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their
              national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan
              constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and
              supercentenarian status, and support a primary role of fraud and
              error in generating remarkable human age records.",

  abstract = "Age is the dominant risk factor for most chronic human diseases;
              yet the mechanisms by which aging confers this risk are largely
              unknown.[1][1] Recently, the age-related acquisition of somatic
              mutations in regenerating hematopoietic stem cell populations was
              associated with both hematologic cancer incidence[2][2]--[4][3]
              and coronary heart disease prevalence.[5][4] Somatic mutations
              with leukemogenic potential may confer selective cellular
              advantages leading to clonal expansion, a phenomenon termed
              `Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential' (CHIP).[6][5]
              Simultaneous germline and somatic whole genome sequence analysis
              now provides the opportunity to identify root causes of CHIP.
              Here, we analyze high-coverage whole genome sequences from 97,691
              participants of diverse ancestries in the NHLBI TOPMed program
              and identify 4,229 individuals with CHIP. We identify
              associations with blood cell, lipid, and inflammatory traits
              specific to different CHIP genes. Association of a genome-wide
              set of germline genetic variants identified three genetic loci
              associated with CHIP status, including one locus at TET2 that was
              African ancestry specific. In silico -informed in vitro
              evaluation of the TET2 germline locus identified a causal variant
              that disrupts a TET2 distal enhancer. Aggregates of rare germline
              loss-of-function variants in CHEK2 , a DNA damage repair gene,
              predisposed to CHIP acquisition. Overall, we observe that
              germline genetic variation altering hematopoietic stem cell
              function and the fidelity of DNA-damage repair increase the
              likelihood of somatic mutations leading to CHIP. [1]: \#ref-1
