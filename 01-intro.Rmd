## Introduction
A haplotype block is a set of closely linked alleles or markers on a chromosome that tend to be inherited together over evolutionary time.

Across Eukaryotes, the frequency of recombination is inversely proportional to overall genome size. The result is that yeast have a recombination rate a few orders of magnitude higher than that of humans (She and Jarosz, 2018).

A haplotype block is a set of closely linked alleles or markers on a chromosome that tend to be inherited together over evolutionary time.

## DNA Replication
When the origin of replication(s) is removed from bacteria or eukaryotes, growth and division is restricted or entirely eliminated, but in some strains of archaea like H volcanii, deletion of the origin of replication accelerates cell growth rates. It turns out that this archaea can use a process that is similar to homologous recombination to create a replication fork and replicate its chromosome (Hawkins et al., 2013).

## Cloning
A macaque was the first primate to be cloned by SCNT (Liu et al., 2018).

## Mutation Rate
Using whole-genome sequencing or next-gen sequencing to determine mutation rates by base, it appears that C>T mutations at CpG sites mutate at a frequency of 10-7 changes/cell division, and all other sites are within the range of 10-8-10-9 base changes per division (Arnheim and Calabrese, 2009, 2016; Campbell and Eichler, 2013; SÃ©gurel et al., 2014).

Providing an example of how human mutation rates can differ by geographic origination, europeans compared to african/asian populations have a 1.6 increased mutation rate of a particular mutation (Harris, 2015).

It appears that humans have the highest germline mutation rate of all analyzed species (Lynch, 2016)

## Mutation Hotspots
There are a number of sporadic mutation hotspots associated with disease incidence, like achondroplasia which has a sporadic incidence rate of 4.5 x 10-5 per generation (Arnheim and Calabrese, 2016; Waller et al., 2008). This disease originates from a single mutation in the FGFR3 gene at a mutation rate ~450 times higher than what would ordinarily be expected at a CpG site (Bellus et al., 1995; Rousseau et al., 1994; Shiang et al., 1994).

## Mutation Detection
Pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization is a mutation detection method that can detect a single mutant molecule of DNA within 25,000 genomes (Liu and Sommer, 2004; Qin et al., 2007).

## Genetic Modifications
Caffeine was cloned to allow for caffeine-deficient coffee and teas without the decaffeination process (Kato et al., 2000).

When a DNA-associating protein from tardigrades was cloned into mammalian cells, they became about 40% more tolerant to radiation (Hashimoto et al., 2016).

## Sequencing Methods
Using a new sequencing method called sci-RNA-seq, the transcriptome of every cell of 762 cells in C Elegans was sequenced to yield single-cell sequencing results and transcriptome profiling of every cell in the body. The way this is done is by methanol fixing nuclei and then incorporating a UMI when converting to cDNA, then mixing cells again and incorporating another UMI when synthesizing the other strand (Cao et al., 2017).

It appears that DAPI does not increase sequencing error rates by Illumina sequencing (Leung et al., 2016).

One group came up with a method that is essentially identical to mine in which they use barcoded probes to detect leukemia but they tracked the mutation manually and ignored background (Wong et al. 2015)

## Diagnostics
In Li and Snyder Cell 2018, the EHR from hospitals is used to integrate with a machine learning algorithm trained on aneurysm detection. Patients are then whole genome sequenced, and the genome sequencing plus the lifestyle of the individual on EHR is then used to predict if the person has an aneurysm. They were able to achieve pretty robust detection results that could then be used in a prediction setting in the clinic.
